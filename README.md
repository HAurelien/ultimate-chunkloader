# Ultimate ChunkLoader

Starting from a joke between a few friends and me, this mod came to life as my first experience in the minecraft modding community.

With this mod, you can easily load any chunk of the map on your server whenever you need to. Just interact once with it, and it will be added to the list of known anchors for you to turn on or off whenever you need to thanks to the remote.
The original reason behind this mod was the possibility to access remote services from other mods requiring the chunk to be loaded, while keeping a minimum server load. Working through multiple dimensions, I wanted to keep it as user-friendly as possible.


## How to use


Once you have installed it, you will need two things for it to function : an Anchor, and a remote.

### Crafting

The remote

### The Anchor

Once the anchor have been placed in a chunk, all you need to do is to interact with it. Once that's done, you can use the remote, to display all the anchors you know.

### The Remote

When you use the remote, you will be displayed all the anchors you have interacted with, allowing you to turn them on and off, as well as renaming or removing them. (The list, as well as the names it contains, are personal)

Multiple players can add the same anchor to their list and activate/deactivate it at will.
